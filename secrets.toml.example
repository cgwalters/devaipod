# Example secrets configuration for devc
# Save this file to ~/.config/devc/secrets.toml
#
# Note: This file is currently not used by devc. Instead, use the --secret
# command-line flag to pass secrets directly:
#
#   devc new --secret anthropic-key=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY my-workspace
#
# This example file shows the TOML format that could be used for future
# enhancements where secrets are loaded from configuration files.
